# Financial Analysis of Company Records

## About the Project
### PyBank
#### Introduction
This Python script is designed to analyze the financial records of a company. It reads in a dataset named `budget_data.csv`, which contains two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". The script calculates various financial metrics over the given period.

#### Metrics Calculated
1. **Total Months** : Calculates the total number of months included in the dataset.
2. **Total Profit/Losses**: Computes the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
3. **Average Change**: Calculates the average of changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
4.**Greatest Increase in Profits**: Identifies the date and amount of the greatest increase in profits.
5. **Greatest Decrease in Profits**: Identifies the date and amount of the greatest decrease in profits.

### PyPoll
#### Introduction
This Python script aids in modernizing the vote-counting process for a small, rural town. It analyzes a dataset named  `election_data.csv`, which contains three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". The script calculates various voting metrics.

#### Metrics Calculated
1. **Total Votes**: Calculates the total number of votes cast.
2. **Candidates List**: Provides a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. **Percentage of Votes Each Candidate Won**: Computes the percentage of votes each candidate won.
4. **Total Votes Each Candidate Won**: Calculates the total number of votes each candidate won.
5. **Winner**: Identifies the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Usage
#### PyBank

1. Ensure you have the <code style ="color:blue">[budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv)</code> file containing your financial data.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the **main.py** script and the **"budget_data.csv'** file.
